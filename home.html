					<p>Home is a fluid term for me.  I have lived in 14 houses, 9 dorm rooms, in 4 countries over the past 25 years.  As much as I enjoy traveling and experiencing new cultures it makes it difficult to answer the question of <i>Where are you from?</i></p>
					<h2 class="boldClass">Milwaukee</h2>
					<p>Milwaukee is where I am living now.  This is where my mother grew up and where my father spent part of his childhood.  It is where we always came to visit when I was a child and when we moved back to American is it where my parents chose to move to.</p>
					<h3 class="boldClass">Israel/Palestine</h3>
					After graduating from university the opportunity came up for me to go to Bethlehem and work at a small American school.  I jumped at the chance to go back overseas and loved it so much I stayed a second year.
					<h4 class="boldClass">Stevens Point</h4>
					<p>This is where I first lived as an adult in America.  I attended the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Dietetics.</p>
					<h5 class="boldClass">India</h5>
					<p>During my highschool years I attended a small international boarding school in South India.  Though there were many hard things about living in a boarding school, I loved those years and cherish the friendships that I made there.</p>
					<h6 class="boldClass">Bangladesh</h6>
					<p>This is where my parents worked for 22 years.  I was born in the USA when my parents were there visiting family, but moved back to Bangladesh after a few months.  I spent the majority of my childhood there living in Dhaka, the capital city.</p>
